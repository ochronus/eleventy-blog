# Key traits and behaviors of great managers
1. Good managers are skilled at asking questions that give their team members a new perspective on the problem and reach the right solution on their own.
2. Good managers listen, then listen some more, and then some more.
3. Good managers address context first, then content. They don’t just stick a new process as a band-aid over deep culture wounds & hope that the pain goes away. They know that most problems are interpersonal problems at their core. They have a knack for identifying the root cause.
4. Good managers use their eloquence, charisma, and writing skills as tools, never as weapons.
5. Good managers know that, above all else, they are agents of their company. Their default mode is to make and facilitate company-optimal choices.
6. Good managers know that fixing broader company culture is an important part of their role as a designated leader within the company.
7. Good managers put their team members above their own self-interest when the two are in conflict.
8. Good managers understand that the long game is all about people. They put an individual’s mental & physical well-being above short term OKRs & results. They pay keen attention to a team member’s feelings in addition to their spoken words & can detect dissonance between the two.
9. Good managers consistently get results through their team. They have high standards for inputs, outputs, and outcomes. They aren’t satisfied with just meeting the minimum permissible bar for metrics, product quality, customer satisfaction, team collaboration, and so on.
10. Good managers are proactive about their team members’ career growth. They don’t dread career conversations with team members, they actively invite such conversations.
11. Good managers don’t have just one go-to management style nor do they have a notion of “THE ideal employee”. Good managers aim to create an inclusive & optimal environment for each individual, based on their specific strengths, weaknesses, preferred style of learning & working
12. Good managers can discern good intent from bad. They have zero tolerance for self-serving behavior that sabotages the team or the company, even if it’s coming from an otherwise highly competent team member.
13. Good managers are confident & secure in their role.
They model High Agency.
They have a mature attitude & avoid pettiness.
They know it’s fine to express vulnerability.
They say “I don’t know” when that’s true.
They love learning.
They exude presence.
14. Good managers value clear thinking, sound judgment, & wisdom. They try their best, but also realize they (& others) are fallible & anyone can have a bad day. They know that their own growth as a manager isn’t a binary quantity, it’s a continuous process.
