##[CS 110L: Safety in Systems Programming](https://reberhardt.com/cs110l/spring-2020/)
A proper “safe programming” course mostly in Rust. This is the first of its kind that I see, looks really exciting! This class is focused on safety and robustness in systems programming: Where do things often go wrong in computer systems? How can we avoid common pitfalls?

##[How to remember what you learn](https://vasilishynkarenka.com/learning/)
Tl; dr – Make it time-based, apply meta-cognition & active recall, and learn what you’re curious about. The author walks you through his workflow for studying books and articles. I’ve read bits and pieces of this method but so far haven’t seen such a comprehensive summary.

##[How narcissistic leaders infect their organizations’ cultures](https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/research/how-narcissistic-leaders-infect-their-organizations-culture/)
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who’s the fairest of them all?

##[Restoring Democracy – A Thought Experiment](https://lashoun.com/learning/restoring-democracy-a-thought-experiment/)
This article was eye-opening for me. I’m not a big fan of politics but it seems we’re all playing this game whether we want to or not. The article gives a great introduction to how different voting systems work around the world and a few properties of those and theorems, too. It’s easy to follow and I’ve learnt a lot from it.

##[Learning at work is work](https://ochronus.online/learning-at-work-is-work/)
Talking about learning… Everyone agrees that constant learning and having a growth mindset are fundamental to success in software engineering. Yet once you’re done with onboarding at your new job as a software engineer the rat race seems to begin, leaving no dedicated time for learning. Let me offer an alternative.
