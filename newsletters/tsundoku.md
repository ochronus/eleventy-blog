**_Tsundoku_** – it means acquiring reading materials but letting them pile up in one’s home without reading them. The word dates back to the very beginning of modern Japan, the Meiji era (1868-1912) and has its origins in a pun. _Tsundoku_, which literally means reading pile, is written in Japanese as 積ん読. _Tsunde oku_ means to let something pile up and is written 積んでおく. Some wag around the turn of the century swapped out that _oku_ (おく) in _tsunde oku_ for _doku_ (読) – meaning to read. Then since _tsunde doku_ is hard to say, the word got mushed together to form _tsundoku_.

I’m definitely guilty of this habit to some extent meanwhile I hope that my newsletter is _not_ adding to your pile of unread materials.

## [FizzBuzz – SIMD Style!](https://www.morling.dev/blog/fizzbuzz-simd-style/)

Maybe you don’t need to go _this_ deep in an interview but it’s a really interesting and elaborate post on the Vector API in Java to speed our old friend the fizzbuzz challenge up 🙂

## [Why software projects take longer than you think: a statistical model](https://erikbern.com/2019/04/15/why-software-projects-take-longer-than-you-think-a-statistical-model.html)

This is my second favorite post on the topic right after [Joseph Pelrine’s talk](http://josephpelrine.com/estimating/). Anyone who built software for a while knows that estimating timelines is _hard_. It’s hard to come up with an unbiased estimate of how long something will take when fundamentally the work in itself is about _solving_ something. Let’s look at the statistical model behind it.

## [Kindness is a hidden software engineering superpower](https://ochronus.online/kindness-software-engineering-superpower/)

As fuzzy and weird it sounds, kindness is a hidden superpower for software engineers. It helps your peers feel safe, and if they feel safe people take the risks that enable efficient, honest communication and thus real collaboration. It’s not about holding each others’ hands in a nice field and singing Kumbaya, but very real, actual things you can do.

## [All By Myself](https://www.historytoday.com/archive/history-matters/all-myself)

Solitude was treated with suspicion in the Middle Ages. For most people, it has only been a possibility in recent times. In modern western society, time for oneself, alone and in private, is taken for granted. In medieval Europe, when life was a far more communal experience than it is today, solitude was considered “the worst form of poverty”.

## [The future of work after COVID-19](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/the-future-of-work-after-covid-19)

The clever folks at McKinsey created a report which gives some prediction on how work will look like after the end of the pandemic. Of course, it’s just a possible future but feels like they did good research there. I think it’s a must-read for both individual contributors and managers.

## [Fun: did you know that brewing tea has an ISO standard?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3103)

It’s ISO 3103, short and sweet and super fun – hint: the protocol has been criticized for omitting any mention of prewarming the pot. Ireland was the only country to object, and objected on technical grounds.
