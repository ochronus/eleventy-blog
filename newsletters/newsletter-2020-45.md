Happy Sunday dear subscribers! After a tough week for a big part of the world, especially our friends in the U.S. sit back and relax the next batch of curated articles ✨​
​
## [Study: Focus will shape the future of distributed work](https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/work-culture/economist-intelligence-unit-distributed-work-study)

The author argues about the importance of focus for work (duh) and then talks about how COVID and home office affected our capability to focus. Four in ten people say they feel more focused at home, while another three report no change. But nearly a third have had the opposite experience, feeling “somewhat less” able to focus.

## [How I talk to the victims of conspiracy theories](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-54738471)

I never thought I'd link anything from BBC here, but I was wrong. This is a skill we'll all need to master if we want to change the world for the better. The article introduces Sebastian Shemirani whose mom is a 'conspiracy influencer' - there's an interview with him about this [here](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3cszvsf) (18 minutes of audio).

## [​The Most Famous Paradox in Physics Nears Its End](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-black-hole-information-paradox-comes-to-an-end-20201029/)

Psst psst it's about black holes! In a landmark series of calculations, physicists have proved that black holes can shed information, which seems impossible by definition. The work appears to resolve a paradox that Stephen Hawking first described five decades ago.

## ​[The Type of Team Diversity You’re Probably Not Paying Attention To](https://firstround.com/review/the-type-of-team-diversity-youre-probably-not-paying-attention-to/)

This article makes my eye twitch for two things: First, it's less about diversity than good team composition (which is great, but the title!!) and second, because I'm against categorizing people (which the article does to some extent). Yet, if we abstract it a bit it's a nice model, another lens to look at teams and personal development through.

## [The top 11 technical interview myths](https://ochronus.online/technical-interview-myths/)

While we are at clickbait titles... ;) I write about common misconceptions in recruitment and try to debunk some. Let's see if I succeed.
