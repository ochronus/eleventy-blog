## [Stuff I’ve learned about Diversity, Equity and Inclusion over the past few years.](https://lethain.com/stuff-learned-about-dei-2020/)
Will Larson’s articles are always an interesting read. Click and you won’t be disappointed – learn why a metrics-first approach doesn’t work here and how unconscious bias trainings may increase reliance on stereotypes rather reduce it.

## [Management via Worry and Crisis](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/management-via-worry-and-crisis/)
Rands is my other all-time favorite author – this time he talks about a few negative default manager behaviors. A good read for both individual contributors and managers so both can identify when it’s happening.

## [As Your Team Gets Bigger, Your Leadership Style Has to Adapt](https://hbr.org/2019/03/as-your-team-gets-bigger-your-leadership-style-has-to-adapt)
Sounds like a no-brainer, but there are nuances to it – read the article for some real-world challenges you and your org will face as it grows. One spoiler, or rather teaser: “People-Centric Skills Matter Most” 😉

## [The basics of one on one meetings](https://ochronus.online/the-basics-of-one-on-ones/)
Conducting good one on one sessions is one of the most frustrating skills new engineering leads need to learn – I hope my post helps them a bit.

# Happy Halloween, all!
