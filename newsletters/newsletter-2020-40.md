From now on I’ll write up a weekly selection of articles I’ve found interesting – not necessarily all of them will be from the specific week. This is a future newsletter, but for now I’ll start testing out formats, structures and different kinds of selections. Pretty please leave comments whether this is useful or interesting to you or not.

## [You’re exhausted and burned out because work is terrible](https://www.askamanager.org/2020/09/youre-exhausted-and-burned-out-because-work-is-terrible.html)
Alison Green argues that our expectations and relation to what work is or what it can be is wildly misaligned and this is one constant source of misery. It’s mostly about the proverbial millennials and the way we were taught to think about work and life. Can’t say I disagree. Some of the comments are golden, too!

## [Reasons revealed for the brain’s elastic sense of time](https://www.quantamagazine.org/reasons-revealed-for-the-brains-elastic-sense-of-time-20200924/)
In our subjective experience, time stretches and contracts. New research finds that the subjective experience of time is linked to learning, thwarted expectations and neural fatigue. Super interesting piece about how dopamine plays a key role in both learning and our perception of time.

## [We learn faster when we aren’t told what choices to make](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-learn-faster-when-we-arent-told-what-choices-to-make/)
This article talks about how choice has a clear influence on decision-making and learning effectiveness. It boils down to our sense of control heavily determines whether we learn or not in certain situations. I think we always knew this anecdotally but it’s nice to see an actual study about it. This has a direct effect on how we should approach learning both for ourselves and creating efficient learning environments for others.

## [Recognize your management wins](https://larahogan.me/blog/recognize-your-management-wins/)
A great set of advice from Lara Hogan here – based on discussions with my fellow managers we (managers) are really bad at celebrating or even realizing our wins. I’ve been personally struggling with this for years. It was refreshing to read about our usual areas of influence and some practical ideas about what to look for when thinking about our wins.

## [How to stop winning arguments](https://ochronus.online/how-to-stop-winning-arguments/)
Finally, a shameless plug – an article from me about the fact that we tend to treat arguments as fights or zero-sum games which hinders their original purpose of getting to alignment and making our ideas better and more diverse.
