Dear subscribers, I hope you had an amazing week – welcome to this edition of my newsletter. Now sit back, put up your feet and enjoy this week’s collection of interesting articles 💜

## [Computer Scientists Achieve ‘Crown Jewel’ of Cryptography](https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-achieve-crown-jewel-of-cryptography-20201110/)
It feels we’re seeing a scientific breakthrough almost every week now – this time it is indistinguishability obfuscation (iO for short), “one cryptographic primitive to rule them all”. There is likely only one thing that could break the new scheme: a quantum computer but there seems to be a potential route to iO that might be secure even from quantum attacks.

## [10 Insights from Adopting TypeScript at Scale](https://www.techatbloomberg.com/blog/10-insights-adopting-typescript-at-scale/)
A few years ago, Bloomberg Engineering decided to adopt TypeScript as a first-class supported language. This article shares insights and lessons they learned during this journey. It’s a really nice and useful read on multiple levels.

## [Managing technical quality in a codebase.](https://lethain.com/managing-technical-quality/)
If there’s one thing that engineers, engineering managers, and technology executives are likely to agree on, it’s that there’s a crisis of technical quality. There seems to be an eternal struggle between feature delivery speed and solution quality. Will Larson explores the topic, grab some popcorn, and read it.

## [How to take meeting notes](https://barehands.substack.com/p/how-to-take-meeting-notes)
Plot twist: take notes after the meeting. Vasili is really good at dissecting a seemingly trivial topic, showing all the nuances you might have never thought of, and giving amazing practical advice. I’m a subscriber, look around on his substack and you might become one, too 😉

## [Acing your technical interview – a hiring manager’s guide](https://ochronus.online/acing-the-tech-interview/)
Learn how to prepare and excel at your next technical interview with these tips from a seasoned hiring manager. Erm, yeah, that’s supposed to be me 😅
