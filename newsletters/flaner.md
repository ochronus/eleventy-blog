_**Flâner**_ – Perhaps one of the most Parisian of all French words, the verb “_flâner_” was defined in the 19th century by the Paris literary crowd. It refers to the art of leisurely strolling the streets of Paris without any goal or destination simply for the pleasure of soaking up the city’s beauty. These aimless pedestrians are known as “_flâneurs_.”
