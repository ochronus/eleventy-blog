I’ve interviewed a few hundred software engineering candidates in the past 10+ years and designed hiring processes. I’ve been supporting software engineers for 6+ years, having worked with ~40 engineers as their engineering manager. My experience is limited to startups and mid-sized companies, so take everything you read here with that in mind.

## What skills is your next employer looking for? {data-toc-exclude}
Raw coding skills are only a fraction of what your future dream company is looking for. There are also the so-called “soft skills” – I personally don’t like this term – let’s simply call them skills, too. Both are crucial to your job. I’ll walk you through each skill area, reason about its importance, and then show you the usual expectations depending on your level.

## Communication
![Communication](/img/communication.png "Communication" =200x200){.float-left} First and foremost, communication skills matter a lot. This is the foundation for performing well in those tasks listed above. This is a long topic on its own, but a tl; dr is: You should communicate with others effectively. You need to express your thoughts in a clear way that’s easy to follow for others.
You need empathy so you can understand how to approach other people. Consciously using communication styles will help you later in your career.

Let’s see the nuances of all this broken down by each level. Keep in mind that companies will have different definitions for these levels and that these are ranges, too. I’ll try to be as generic as I can without sacrificing relevance.

<section class="indent-left">

The ability to **express your thoughts clearly** is a must on every level. You will work in a team and communicating with others is a significant part of your everyday job. While you’ll mostly talk to other engineers and that assumes a sizeable common vocabulary you still need to be conscious about how easy your train of thoughts is to follow.

**Empathy** is also not optional. Empathy in communication means you can understand what emotions and state of mind others have in certain situations and take that into account when you’re communicating. One trivial example is simply waiting for a better time with your question about how the database schema is migrated when you see that the other person is in a very frustrating bug hunt elsewhere in the system. Another is adjusting your message when you’re giving feedback on a pull request and you understand that the person making the changes is emotionally attached to their solution.

**Active listening** goes hand in hand with empathy – it keeps you engaged with your conversation partner positively. It is the process of listening attentively while someone else speaks, paraphrasing and reflecting what is said, and withholding judgment and advice.

Some common situations in which your communication skills is essential to your success:

* Effective dialogues on pull request reviews
* Writing good documentation with the target audience and their (lack of) context in mind
* Giving feedback to others

### Mid-level engineers {data-toc-exclude}
<section class="indent-left">

In addition to the above, more tenured software engineers will need to rely even more on communication to extend their scope of impact.

You will be owning complete user stories, sometimes even projects and you’ll be responsible for coming up with plans in collaboration with the rest of the team, your Product Manager, and your Engineering Manager.

You will break down these projects into actionable steps and agree on them with your peers. You’ll need to add descriptions and acceptance criteria to these tasks so anyone can pick them up without much additional context.

Communication here starts shifting as you start shifting into technological and project leadership. [Inclusive communication](https://medium.com/@sarah.cordivano/inclusive-communication-three-principles-cb8dbb6361cd) becomes the next milestone – that will be one new key factor in deciding whether you’re successful in your role or not. Whether you can lead a project with truly involving and empowering others will have an effect not only on the project’s success but on team culture and mood, too.

### Senior engineers {data-toc-exclude}
<section class="indent-left">

For senior software engineers communicating on the next level becomes crucial to build out and maintain their network and influence over the organization. Stakeholders are of all kinds on this level, sometimes including CEOs and VPs.

On this level you are expected to be successful in being the tech lead of a team that involves aligning engineers with your technological vision, being the primary point of contact for other teams, and being a strategic peer for your Product Manager and your Engineering Manager.

You will be forming tech visions and you’ll need to communicate about those effectively.

To be successful, senior engineers need a wide network of peers across the organization – other senior engineers, managers, and people from different departments, such as customer success, sales, and marketing.

Staff engineers usually talk to VPs (Vice President of X) and sometimes C-level executives too.

Different kinds of stakeholders and peers require different approaches to getting your message through and understanding what’s important for them. Empathy alone is not enough anymore: you need to utilize different communication styles, too. A discussion about a topic needs technical depth when you’re talking to your engineering peers, and your VP will need a birds-eye-view of the same topic in the 30 minutes they can dedicate to listening to your proposal. Non-technical peers require different approaches with a different “language” and taxonomy. [This article](https://www.samatters.com/19-ways-communications-barriers-can-impact-situational-awareness/) is a good summary of how situational awareness and communication relate to each other.

[In a study Peakon found](https://peakon.com/heartbeat/reports/the-employee-voice/) that communication was the second thing most employees would like to change – right after salary.

## Problem-solving

![Problem solving](/img/problem-solving.png "Problem solving" =200x200){.float-left} It’s commonplace, but software engineers are usually inherently good problem solvers. There are more nuances to it though – you need **analytical skills**, **critical thinking**, a good **understanding of tradeoffs**, and quite a bit of **creativity**. You also need to understand that writing code is not the only way to solve a problem. You need to be able to **break down** bigger problems into digestible size sub-problems and then **synthesize** their solutions.

## Teamwork

![Teamwork](/img/teamwork.png "Teamwork" =200x200){.float-left} Another buzzword, right? I agree, this term is overloaded and overused, but it does have real meaning. When I think of ‘teamwork skills’ I see an overlap with communication but also understanding how **skills (and personalities!)** work together, complement each other, potential points of **conflicts**, how to mitigate them, being **humble** and **respecting** your teammates, **active listening**, being open to **compromise** and **feedback,** and above all, understanding that a team can achieve so much more than any individual.

## Growth mindset and learning

![Growth mindset and learning](/img/growth-mindset-learning.png "Growth mindset and learning" =200x200){.float-left} Another commonplace. The original value proposition for a growth mindset is under heavy fire, but the core still holds – people who are confident failing from time to time and use those occasions to **learn**, people who look at the world with a “**can do**” attitude, who consider challenges and the effort to overcome them as the path to mastery do better in software engineering jobs. Having such people on the team also **strengthens the team culture**. This field is changing like crazy on many levels and is a paradise for people who love to learn.

## Being kind

![Being kind](/img/kindness.png "Being kind" =200x200){.float-left} Sounds fuzzy and a bit bulls*itty, right? Well, it turns out if your teammates are pricks you tend to quit or stay and be unhappy and demotivated. This is not fluff, studies and surveys confirm this. We spend a lot of time in our work communities and it’s extremely important to be surrounded by people who care, with whom we feel comfortable.

This does not depend on levels – it’s a universal trait. It’s also technically not a skill, yet there’s a surprising amount of practice involved in getting better to show kindness. This is not just about having a positive attitude by default – but being genuinely kind to others.

When faced with a frustrating situation don’t assume malice. Assume good intentions and reach out to clarify.

Show interest in your peers’ wellbeing, this goes from simply asking them how their weekend went to remembering they had a hard time with something two weeks ago and following up on that. It’s really these simple, everyday things, but doing them consistently.

Remember that I said it doesn’t depend on levels? Well, there’s one nuance – the more your perceived power and authority shifts as you level up, the more aware you need to be to practice active kindness. One reason for this is that most people will get less engaged and even demotivated when working with someone cold in power. Another reason is that people look at you for leadership, and your behavior will get copied, so you’re responsible for leading by example.

In a [2013 article](https://hbr.org/2013/01/the-price-of-incivility) published in Harvard Business Review, Christine Porath said her work shows that teams that work in an environment where rudeness, bullying, demeaning comments, and insults are commonplace usually become fractured and people lose confidence, have low levels of trust and become less helpful. Bad behavior, she adds, destroys collaboration, is harmful to mental health, and has been proven to be a major barrier to efficiency.

Forbes argues that [kindness is a competitive advantage](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellevate/2018/03/06/science-proves-kindness-is-your-competitive-advantage/). I hope it becomes the standard.

In a [study Peakon found](https://peakon.com/heartbeat/reports/the-employee-voice/) that their coworkers was the 4th item most employees would like to change – right after salary, communication and management.

## Tech skills

![Tech skills](/img/coding.png "Tech skills" =200x200){.float-left} You’re probably wondering why this is the last point. For me – in this list – this is the least important, to be honest, after a certain level. I need to see that you’re good at at least something but if I believe you want to and can learn, I’m completely fine hiring you even with gaps in your tech skills. As I said in the intro up to a certain level it’s easy (or rather, straightforward) to grow your tech skills. If you can’t communicate properly though, I’m less confident I’ll be able to successfully coach you or even wheter you’re open to coaching, to begin with. That said, there are some deeper skills here which are just as hard to learn such as code hygiene, architectures, software engineering principles – among others.
