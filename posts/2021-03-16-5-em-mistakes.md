Starting in a new role as a fresh engineering manager is not easy. Suddenly you need very different skills, feedback loops seem insanely long and the sense of accomplishment and success starts fading as a result.

Earlier I wrote about [4 key ways even experienced engineering managers fail](https://ochronus.online/engineering-manager-4-ways-of-failure/). This time I’m specifically elaborating what usual mistakes folks who were recently still individual contributors and just became engineering managers make.

## Still doing much technical work

This is the number one of all the usual mistakes of new engineering managers. Sometimes even the career ladder is set up in a way that encourages this, there’s the concept of the ‘tech lead manager’ which is supposed to be 50% programming and 50% people management – in my experience it doesn’t work well in the long run, I’ll elaborate why below. You might still be writing some code if you’re managing a very small team and that’s temporarily OK. It is critical though that you step back on technical decisions to make room for the team members to own things and grow and enable the team to scale.

There are multiple reasons for doing programming or architectural design as an engineering manager is a bad idea:

1. It’ll hinder the much-needed growth in your new skills. Not having enough time to invest in your newly found leadership skills is a grave error. Even if the math seems OK there’s going to be the cost of context switching. You should be spending all the time when you’re not executing in your new role to learn about your new role.
2. You simply won’t have enough time to do both well. Well, usually you won’t do either well.
3. You won’t give enough room to your direct reports to grow and own things.
4. You’ll be blocking your team by having projects depend on you (especially if you own architectural design).
5. You won’t be able to scale the team this way – with you being a single point of failure and not having anyone to delegate to.


These are the major reasons new engineering managers do this:

1. They are misaligned with expectations and think they still need to do programming or architectural design.
2. They are not yet confident in their new role and they fall back to what they know they’ll feel productive and useful in.
3. They don’t (think they) have senior enough engineers on their team to make technical decisions or they don’t trust them.
4. There’s just too much to do in the team and they want to jump in and help.
If you keep focusing on your personal contributions, such as writing code, architectural design, and day-to-day decision-making, you will constrain your team to only what you can fit into your own schedule. This is not the way to scale your team. If it’s usually your code that gets them over the finish line, you’re missing the point. You aren’t providing growth and scaling for the team, you’re providing some extra value as an engineer. If it’s another engineer that your team needs then hire one!

### How to fix it
Well, first, figure out your real reason(s) for still doing significant tech work in your team. Be honest with yourself.

If the root cause is that you want to feel more successful and you regularly fall back to programming or architectural design then just trust me and take a leap of faith. You have a new role now with different responsibilities. Focusing on your team’s health and growth will pay much higher dividends than still being half an engineer.

If this is about missing capacity or skills in your team then you need to make a plan, sell it and execute on it. Depending on the situation you might need to work on expectation management with your team’s stakeholders, giving them a more realistic timeline, and/or start planning out the future of your team – meaning headcount AND skillsets, too. It’s OK to be the person driving the high-level technical decisions for a while, but you should have a plan in place about how you’ll grow or hire your successor in that role.
